    "## Problem 1: Lambda functions and list comprehension\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part A \n",
    "Assume you are given two lists `la` and `lb` of the same length, write code to multiply these two lists element by element and assign the result to lc, **in one line**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have are given two lists:\n",
    "```\n",
    "la = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "lb = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n",
    "```\n",
    "If we print out lc, we will get \n",
    "```\n",
    "[6, 14, 24, 36, 50]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Version 1 (10%)\n",
    "map() function and lambda function (10%)\n",
    "#### Version 2 (10%)\n",
    "Use list comprehension (10%)\n",
    "Hint:\n",
    "A lambda function can take more than one input argument.  For example\n",
    "```\n",
    "lambda x, y: x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "Check: If you print out lc, the correct result should be \\[6, 14, 24, 36, 50]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part B\n",
    "You are give a list of numbers `l`.  However, some of the numbers are in int type, some are in string type.  Convert the list of numbers all to integer type, **in one line** of code. Assign the result of a list `lc`. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 = [1, 2, \"3\", 11, \"13\", 15, \"17\"]\n",
    "lc = ....some code...\n",
    "print(lc)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Version 1 (10%)\n",
    "Use map() and lambda function\n",
    "#### Version 2 (10%)\n",
    "Use list comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint:\n",
    "* You may need to use the type() function, and the fact that True can be convert to 1 and False can be converted to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check:\n",
    "Input: \n",
    "* Input: l = \\[1, 2, \"3\", 11, \"13\", 15, \"17\"]\n",
    "* If you print out lc, the correct result should be \\[1, 2, 3, 11, 13, 15, 17] \n",

    "## Problem 2: Iterator (30%)\n",
    "Implement an Interator `rand_iter(low, high, target)` that generate random numbers uniformly between low and high (inclusive).  When the random number hits the target, the Iterator will stop. If target > high, or target < low, the iterator will iterate zero times and terminate immediately.  (The key point is that this a loop using this iterator will execute random number of times.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we execute the following loop:\n",
    "```\n",
    "for i in random_iter(1, 5, 4):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The output may be \n",
    "```\n",
    "3, 3, 2, 5, 1, 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 3: Operator overload \n",
    "### Part A (20%)\n",
    "Write a Vector class so that now it implement vector addition, and vector inner product.  In addition, a tuple or a list representing a vector can also be added to a Vector or multipled to a Vector.  Note if the input tuple or list has more than two elements, you can simply ignore the elements beyond the 2nd one.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "p1 = Vector(1,2)\n",
    "p3 = p1 + (5, 6)\n",
    "p4 = p1 + [7, 8]\n",
    "p5 = p1 + (7, 8, 9)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(p3)  # You should get v(6, 8)\n",
    "print(p4)  # You should get v(8, 10)\n",
    "print(p5)  # you shuold also get v(8, 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "p6 = Vector(3, 4)\n",
    "n7 = p1 * p6\n",
    "n8 = p1 * (5, 6)\n",
    "print(n7)  # You should get 11\n",
    "print(n8)  # You should get 17\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "###Part B (10%)\n",
    "Implement a class method `total_points()` that return the number of Vectors created using this class so far.  Notice that the total number of Vectors created include the ones you created explictely and the ones the system creates for you when you perform Vector mathematics.\n",
