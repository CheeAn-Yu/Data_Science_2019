    "## Problem 1: (Extract data and handling of CSV files and RDB) 20%\n",
    "* Download data from 2019.06.01 to 20190.10.09 for stock number 2330 from Taiwan Stock Exchange website, into CSV file(s).\n",
    "* Read data from CSV into Pandas Data Frame.\n",

    "Note1.1: Important! Please read!!\n",
    "在股票交易中, 有所謂的\"停止交易日\". 在這一天, 這一支股票停止交易, 因此也不會有交易資料。在我們的數據中, 如果有遇到股票\"停止交易日\" 請同學們拿前一天的數據補進去。例如, 如果7月15日和七月16日是停止交易日, 在做相關運算時, 就拿7月14日的資料填進7月15日和七月16日的對應欄位。\n",
    "類似這樣子的處理, 在data science 中稱為data cleansing (或data cleaning), 它也是 data science 裡重要的一部分。\n",
    "Note1.2: 有同學下課來討論時, 我曾經說把停止交易日從序列中拿掉。但在權衡後, 覺得Note1.1的方法較為簡單。\n",

    "Note: You can actually use SQL to calculate moving average, too, if you know how to use the window functions in SQL.  So you are also allowed use SQL to answer 2.B if you prefer to.\n",
