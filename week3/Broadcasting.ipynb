If all input arrays do not have the same number of dimensions, a ��1�� will be repeatedly prepended to the shapes of the smaller arrays until all the arrays have the same number of dimensions.\n","\n","2. arrays with a size of 1 along a particular dimension act as if they had the size of the array with the largest shape along that dimension. The value of the array element is assumed to be the same along that dimension for the �營roadcast�� array.\n","\n","3. However, if two arrays have the same number of dimensions, but the sizes of a particular dimension are not the same, it is considered as error, and operation cannot proceed.\n","\n","After application of the broadcasting rules, the sizes of all arrays must match.
