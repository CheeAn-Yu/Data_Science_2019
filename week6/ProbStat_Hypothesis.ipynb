    "**Definition 18.1.**\n",
    "* A statistical hypothesis H is a conjecture about the distribution $f(x; \\theta)$ of a population X. \n",
    "* This conjecture is usually about the parameter $\\theta$ if one is dealing with a **parametric statistics**; otherwise it is\n",

    "**Definition 18.2.**\n",
    "* A hypothesis H is said to be a **simple hypothesis** if H\n",
    "completely specifies the density $f(x; \\theta)$ of the population; \n",
    "* otherwise it is called a **composite hypothesis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 18.3.**\n",
    "* The hypothesis to be tested is called the **null hypothesis**.\n",
    "* The negation of the null hypothesis is called the **alternative hypothesis**. \n",
    "* The null and alternative hypotheses are denoted by $H_0$ and $H_\\alpha$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition: Critical region**\n",
    "* A critical region is a subset of the sample space $(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)$ in which we accept the alternative hypothesis to be true.  \n",
    "* That is, when we obtain a sample from a sequence of random variables $(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)$, \n",
    "  * If th output of $(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)$ turns out to be an element of C, then we decide to accept $H_\\alpha$; otherwise we accept $H_0$.\n",
    "  * We usually a test statistic W(X1, X2, ..., Xn) to determin whether the outcome is in $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark: hypthesis test**\n",
    "* A hypothesis test is a rule that tells us for which sample values we should decide to accept $H_0$ as true and for which sample values we should decide to reject $H_0$ and accept $H_\\alpha$ as true. \n",
    "Typically, a hypothesis test is specified in terms of a test statistic $W$. \n",
    "  * For example, a test might specify that $H_0$ is to be rejected if the sample total $\\sum_{k=1}^n X_k$ is less than 8. In this case the critical region $C$ is the set $\\{(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)|\\: x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_n < 8\\}$.\n",

    "  * Σ is closed under complementation: If A is in Σ, then so is its complement, X \\ A.\n",
    "  * Σ is closed under countable unions: If A1, A2, A3, ... are in Σ, then so is A = A1 ∪ A2 ∪ A3 ∪ … .\n",
    "* From these properties, it follows that the σ-algebra is also closed under countable intersections (by applying De Morgan's laws).\n",
